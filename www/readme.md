# Five9 Hackathon

## The 'thon
How much can you accomplish without writing a single line of CSS?
Try to copy [this design](www/designs/Desktop.png) using only Bootstrap's built-in classes.

###### Rules:
* **NO CSS**. That includes inline styles! You may only edit this index.html file
* NO additional JavaScript libraries
* Do not cheat by using jQuery

###### Guidelines:
* The form does not have to work
* Links/buttons do not need to go anywhere
* The page should be responsive since [desktop](www/designs/Desktop.png) and [mobile](designs/Mobile.png) designs are provided. You may ignore tablet.
* The assets you'll need should all be in the images folder (/www/img/)
